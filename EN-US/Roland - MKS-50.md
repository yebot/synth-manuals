## Features

- The Roland MKS-50 is fully programmable six
voice polyphonic synthesizer sound module
which can be controlled by the external MIDI
device.
- The MIDI Mono Mode makes the MKS-50
extremely useful as the sound module for the
MIDI Guitar System.
- The MKS-50 features the memory capacity that
can store up to 128 different sounds (=Tones)
and the 128 combinations of the Tones and the
performance control functions (=Patches)
- The Chord Memory function allows to play
any of the 16 chords you have programmed
by playing only one key.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The appropriate power supply for this unit is shown on its name plate. Please make sure that the line voltage in your country meets the requirement. 
- Please do not use the same socket used for any noise generating device (such as motor, variable lighting system). 
- This unit might not work properly if turned on immediately after turned off. If this happens, simply turn it off and turn it on again after waiting a few seconds. 
- Before setting up this unit with other devices, turn this unit and all the other units off.
- It is normal for this unit to become warm while it is being operated. 
- Use a soft cloth and clean only with a mild detergent. 
- Do not use solvents such as paint thinner.
- Avoid using this unit in excessive heat or humidity or where it may be affected by direct sunlight or dust. 
- Operating this unit near a neon, fluorescent lamp, TV or CRT Display may cause noise inter- ference. If so, change the angle or the position of the unit.

## ★ MEMORY BACK-UP

- The MKS-50 features a memory back-up system that retains the data even when switched off. The battery that supports the back-up circuit should be replaced every five years. Call for the Roland service station for the battery replacement. (The first replacement may be required before five years, depending on how much time it had passed before you purchased the unit.)
- Please make a memo of the data or save it on to tape before having the MKS-50 repaired. There is no way for restoring the lost data.
- If the Display responds with as shown below, the data in memory may be erased.

## PLAYING

The MKS-50 is the sound module that can be played with the MIDI signal sent from the external device. More than one MIDI message can be received by the MKS-50 using different MIDI Channels I to 16.

Also, the MKS-50 can select the Poly or Mono mode. The Poly mode allows to receive more than one MIDI message on one channel, and the Mono mode allows one MIDI message on one channel. In other words, the MKS-50 is 6 voice polyphonic module in the Polay Mode, and 6 monophonic's with 6 MIDI channels in the Mono mode.

The Poly or Mono mode should be correctly selected on the MKS-50 depending on the external MIDI device.

<!-- TODO: Update this page number make a link -->

When using the MKS-50 as a sound module of the keyboard, sequencer or computer, refer to "MKS-50 as a Sound Module of the Keyboard (Poly Mode)" on page 12.

<!-- TODO: Update this page number make a link -->

Some of the Roland's new model MIDI Guitar System features the MIDI Mono mode, but the previous wpe guitar synthesizers (eg. GR-700, GR-77B) can select only the Poly mode; refer to "MKS-50 as a Sound Module of the Keyboard (Poly Mode)" on page 12.

The MKS-50's Mono mode does not allow to set a different voice for each note separately. This is because each channel is not perfectly independent. The Note Message (e.g. pitch, volume) and the Bender message (guitar's chalking), however, are independent.

<!-- TODO: Update this page number make a link -->
Please read "Mode Selection" on page 42.

### 1. THE MKS-50 AS A SOUND MODULE OF THE MIDI GUITAR SYSTEM (MONO MODE)

To obtain realistic guitar sound without spoiling its characteristic, the MKS-50 features the Mono Mode that allows to receive the signal from each string separately. To use the MKS-50 with the guitar system that provides an independent MIDI channel for each of the strings, read the following instructions.

#### a. Connection

<!-- TODO: inser guitar connection diagram here -->

\* The MIDI THRU Connector sends out the copy of the signal fed into the MIDI IN. This fact technically allows one MIDI divice to control as many extemal MIDI devices. This, however, is not the case in practice. To connect more than three devices, use the optional MIDI THRU BOX MM-4 or MIDI Output Selector MPU-105.

\* The signal fed into the MIDI IN is not sent out throught the MIDI OUT.

#### b. Initialization

The basic setting needed for playing the system is preprogrammed in the MKS-50, but this program may have been changed. To initialize the MKS-SO, turn it on while holding the Number Buttons 3 and 7 down.

\* Please note that initialization witl erase all the current data, replacing it with the preprogram- med data.

Initialization is not needed from the second time you use the MKS-50.

Initializing the MKS-50 which has been used as a usual polyphonic sound module will turn all the Patches to the Mono mode settings.

#### c. Power-up

First of all, make sure that the MKS-50 is correctly
set up with the external device.

1. Turn the MKS-50 on. The Display changes from `*Roland MKS-50*` to `P:A11 **********`.
2. Turn the external MIDI device on.
3. Turn the amplifier on.

#### d. MIDI Channel Setting

The MIDI channels of the connected units should be set to the same number. Unless the MKS-50's receive MIDI channel is set correctly, the necessary MIDI messages cannot be received, therefore the MKS-50 cannot be played properly. 

1. Push the Tune/MIDI Button ④,
2. Push the Parameter Button ⑧ until `MIDI Channel=` is shown in the Display.
3. Using the Value Button ⑨, select the MIDI channel number you want. 

The Roland MIDI-Guitar Converter is designed to transmit MIDI signal to each string separately; the MIDI channel you set is assigned to the 1st string, that plus one to the 2nd string, that plus two to the 3rd string, and so on. For instance, if you set the MIDI channel 2, channel 2 is assigned to the first string, channel 3 to the second string, channel 4 to the third string and so on up to the channel 7 to the sixth string. 

\* In the MIDI Mono mode, do not select the MIDI channel higher than 12. This is because it would make the MIDI channel higher than 16 which cannot be used therefore would mute the string. 

\* The MIDI channel you set is retained in memory even after the MKS-50 is turned off. 

#### e. Tuning

The MKS-50 is played in the pitch of the MIDI signal sent from the guitar, therefore sounds in A4=442Hz standard pitch if the guitar is rightly tuned. If necessary, you can tune the MKS-50 to the guitar. 

1. Push the Tune/MIDI Button ④.
2. Play the guitar, and push the Value Button ⑨ until the MKS-50 is tuned to the guitar.

Pushing the upper side of the Value Button increases the pitch and the lower side decreases. 

The number shown in the Display represents the frequency of the standard pitch (A4). It changes in 1 Hz step, but actually changes almost continu ously (in 0.4 cent steps). 

The ▶ and ◀ shown on the both sides of the number represents as follows:

1. When ▶ is shown, the actual pitch is slightly lower than the value shown in the Display.
2. When ◀ is shown, the actual pitch is slightly higher than the value shown in the display.
3. When both ▶ and ◀  are shown, the value shown in the Display is almost equal to the actual pitch. 

\* The value you set is retained in memory even when the MKS-50 is switched off. 

#### f. Patch Selection in the Internal Memory

#### g. Patch Selection from the External Device
