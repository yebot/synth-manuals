# Erica Synths Black Joystick 2

## Configuration

There are two configurable options available:

1. **Joystick position save** – when switching to other channel. For example, you are in SINE mode on channel 1 and you have set a joystick is a specific position to achieve desired rate/amplitude ratio, and then switch to the channel 2 and record some automations. If a joystick position save is NOT engaged, as soon you switch back to the channel 1, the rate/amplitude ration will be dierent, because the joystick position has changed. If a joystick position save IS engaged, the rate/amplitude ratio will remain the same till you move the joystick through the original position. If you want immediate response from the joystick, we recommend to turn a joystick position save o; if you want more control over joystick position settings, turn a joystick position save on.

2. **Recall of last active channel on powering the module off** – If this option is engaged, the module will save all settings of the last selected channel and recall them next time, you power a case on. In order to access configuration, power a modular case off, push and hold the MODE button, and power the case on. Now, you can push CH1 button to engage the joystick position save and CH2 button to engage recall of last active channel. If the option is engaged, the relevant channel button will be lit.

## Joystick

Move the joystick to control X/Y CV outputs and/or record the motion of the joystick. In the LFO and Drone Oscillator mode X movement of joystick changes the frequency, Y movement – amplitude of the signal on outputs. You can also record LFO automations – frequency and amplitude change. When the motion is recorded in a certain channel, and in the same channel the joystick is moved, the recording is overridden by the movement momentarily. As movement stops, the output CVs smoothly fade back to the recorded motion and playback continues.

## LEDs

The bicolour LEDs indicate the output CV state. Green means the output is positive, yellow - negative.

## Y1; Y2; Y3; Y4

These are CV outputs that correspond to joystick movement along Y axis and these are 90o phase shifted CV outputs in the LFO mode

## X1; X2; X3; X4

These are CV outputs that correspond to joystick movement along X axis and these are primary CV outputs in the LFO mode

## Mode

Select one or several channels simultaneously, you wish to initiate one of four action modes, and then push and hold the MODE button and push one of CHANNEL/MODE buttons to select the output mode. Push and hold the MODE button and push REC button to clear recorded automations on a selected channel.

## Rec

Push and hold the REC button to record a motion of a joystick. Once released the motion will start to play back automatically. A maximum record time is 8” per channel. You can also record frequency/amplitude automations of the LFO and drone/noise oscillator. If automation is recoded and plays back, a LED behind the relevant channel button will be half dimmed until you clear the recording.

## Gate

These are the Gate outputs for channels 3 and 4. In Joystick and SNEW modes a +5V signal is present during a motion of the joystick. In LFO mode and Joystick motion record mode a +5V signal is present when CV is above 0V. This means, you can record rhythmic gates by moving a joystick vertically. The LEDs are on, when the gate is high. When in sine or random LFO mode, the Gate output becomes a random trigger generator, when in drone/noise oscillator mode, the Gate output provides another audio output - squarewave.

## CH1; CH2; CH3; CH4/Mode

These are the CHANNEL SELECT and MODE buttons. Push one or several buttons simultaneously to select the output channel. If several channels are selected simultaneously, you can control parameters on selected channels simultaneously. Buttons of the selected channels will be lit.

Push and hold the MODE button and push one of the CHANNEL/MODE buttons to select the CV output mode of the channel. The button of the selected mode will start to blink. Available modes are:

- **JOYSTICK.** In this mode, depending on a joystick position up to -5V to +5V signals are available on X and Y outputs. You can record up to 8” of a motion of the joystick by pushing and holding the REC button. The recorded motion will start to loop automatically. To clear the recording push and hold the MODE button and push the REC button.

- **SINEWAVE LFO/DRONE OSCILLATOR.** In this mode you have low frequency sinewave on the X output and same, but 90o phase shifted sinewave on the Y output. X position of the joystick defines the frequency of the sinewave, Y position defines the amplitude. You can record the change of the frequency and amplitude by pushing and holding the REC button. The recorded motion will start to loop automatically. To clear the recording push and hold the MODE button and push the REC button. To switch to the DRONE OSCILLATOR mode (audio frequency sinewave) push and hold the MODE button and push the relevant channel button for 2". The channel button will become 50% dimmed, and next time, you select a channel, it will be in drone oscillator mode. To turn drone oscillator mode o, push and hold the MODE button and push the relevant channel button for 2". Try to use all 8 outputs in the Drone oscillator mode! Please note that the sine oscillator is primarily in intended to work as FM modulation source; as a sound source it may not sound perfect due to 20kHz sampling rate.

- **RANDOM LFO/NOISE OSCILLATOR.** In this mode you have stepped random voltages on the X and Y outputs. X position of the joystick defines the frequency of the random voltage change, Y position defines the amplitude. You can record the change of the frequency and amplitude by pushing and holding the REC button. The recorded motion will start to loop automatically. To clear the recording push and hold the MODE button and push the REC button. You can swith the NOISE OSCILLATOR mode on/o same way as sine oscillator.

- **SNEW** (SOUTH-NORTH-EAST-WEST) **PANNER.** In this mode you have 4x2 CV outputs, each changing from 0V to +5V. Meaning, if you set the SNEW mode on the CHANNEL1 and CHANNEL2, and Y1 outputs 0-+5V, when the joystick is mover from the center right (east), X1 outputs 0-+5V, when the joystick is moved from the center up (north), Y2 outputs 0-+5V, when the joystick is moved from the center to the left (west), X2 outputs 0-+5V, when the joystick is moved from the center to the down (south). Same works for pair of CHANNEL3 and CHANNEL4. This is particularly useful for controlling VCAs in quadraphonic performances or controlling several X-faders, VCAs, VCFs or other modules simultaneously. You can record the motion of the joystick by pushing and holding the REC button. The recorded motion will start to loop automatically. To clear the recording push and hold the MODE button and push the REC button.
 
When operating the Black Joystick2 module you select the CHANNEL, push and hold the MODE button to check, what MODE is selected – the relevant MODE button will start to blink. When you select a dierent mode, all reordered automations are instantly cleared.
